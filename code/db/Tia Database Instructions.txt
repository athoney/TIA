	•	Pick the correct distribution for your operating system and then just follow the installer.
	•	Make sure to remember your password as it will be used to connect to the database.
•	You are then going to start up SQL shell(Psql). You can hit enter all the way through the login details as the default is 
	used in every case until password where you will enter your password.
•	Once in you will just need to enter the command CREATE DATABASE kev;

•	Once Postgres is installed and database created return to your IDE.
•	You’re going to replace in the code the open.sql part of the db.go code with your own password if it is not tia.
•	You then should be good to go! If not please contact William Frost.

To access the database you will need to create a .env file in the server folder. There is a
sample.env file included for reference that contains empty fields and an explanation for each. 

** NOTE ** 
Before you push your changes to your branch (for the first time) make sure that the .env file is not included.
This should be handled in the .gitignore file, however, if for some reason it is not please do not push as this
will put your postgres password on the repository.
